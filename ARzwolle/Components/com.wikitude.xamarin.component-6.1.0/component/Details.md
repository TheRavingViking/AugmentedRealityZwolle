### The Wikitude SDK - Augmented Reality for your own app

The Wikitude SDK is a software library and framework for mobile apps used to create augmented reality experiences. The SDK supports any kind of location based use case as well as use cases which require image recognition and tracking technology (vision based augmented reality). 


### How to code for the Wikitude SDK
The Wikitude SDK builds heavily on web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) to allow developers to write cross platform augmented reality experiences. These augmented reality experiences are called ARchitect worlds and are basically ordinary HTML pages that can utilize the ARchitect API to create objects in augmented reality.

Integrating the Wikitude SDK into your application is done by adding the platform specific view component called `ARchitectView` to your applications user interface. See the setup guide for how to setup a Xamarin project and load an ARchitect World.

Get started with writing augmented reality experiences by viewing through the examples included in the SDK. Each example is explained in detail in this documentation. Additional information about the ARchitect API can be found in the included API specification.

### Free Trial and commercial license

By default the Wikitude SDK comes with no valid license key. Read this chapter on how to [obtain a free trial key](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/triallicense.html).

Then pass your license key into the SDK using the platform specific API.
