{"Name":"Augmented Reality Wikitude SDK","Id":3404,"Alias":"com.wikitude.xamarin.component","Description":"# Wikitude Augmented Reality Xamarin Component\n\n\nThe Wikitude Xamarin Component enables C# developers to embed an augmented reality view into their Xamarin project. One can create a fully featured app with advanced augmented reality features, including image recognition and tracking, location-based augmented reality and rendering of 3D models in an augmented reality scene.\n\n#### The Wikitude Xamarin Component\n\n* Available for iOS and Android\n* Simple and seamless native Xamarin integration\n* Fully customizable augmented reality (AR) view\n* Full feature set of the Wikitude SDK\n* AR content is purely written in HTML and JavaScript\n\n\n### The Wikitude SDK - Augmented Reality for your own app\n\nThe Wikitude SDK is a software library and framework for mobile apps used to create augmented reality experiences. The SDK supports any kind of location based use case as well as use cases which require image recognition and tracking technology (vision based augmented reality). \n\n\n### How to code for the Wikitude SDK\nThe Wikitude SDK builds heavily on web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) to allow developers to write cross platform augmented reality experiences. These augmented reality experiences are called ARchitect worlds and are basically ordinary HTML pages that can utilize the ARchitect API to create objects in augmented reality.\n\nIntegrating the Wikitude SDK into your application is done by adding the platform specific view component called `ARchitectView` to your applications user interface. See the setup guide for how to setup a Xamarin project and load an ARchitect World.\n\nGet started with writing augmented reality experiences by viewing through the examples included in the SDK. Each example is explained in detail in this documentation. Additional information about the ARchitect API can be found in the included API specification.\n\n### Free Trial and commercial license\n\nBy default the Wikitude SDK comes with no valid license key. Read this chapter on how to [obtain a free trial key](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/triallicense.html).\n\nThen pass your license key into the SDK using the platform specific API. \n \n### The Wikitude Developer Portal\nThe \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude Developer Section\u003c/a\u003e should be your first stop when you have specific development related questions.

If you like to use it in a commercial, non-commercial or educational environment you need to purchase a according license. All available licenses are listed on the [Wikitude website](http://www.wikitude.com/products/wikitude-sdk/pricing/) and can be purchased directly from [the online store](http:/www.wikitude.com/store)\n","Version":"6.1.0","Summary":"Augmented Reality Component for the Wikitude SDK.","QuickStart":"## Setup Guide Xamarin Component\n\n#### Introduction to the Augmented Reality View\nFrom a technical point of view the SDK adds a UI component called **ARchitectView**, similar to a web view. In contrast to a standard web view the AR View can render augmented reality content.\n\nContent developed for the AR View is written in JavaScript and HTML. \n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tip\"\u003e\n**Note** In this guide we use the terminology `augmented reality experience` and `ARchitect World` synonymously - both of them refer to augmented reality parts of your application. \n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Android SDK installed on your development machine (Android development __only__)\n* Xcode installed on your development machine (iOS development __only__)\n* \u003ca href=\"http://xamarin.com/download\"\u003eXamarin Studio\u003c/a\u003e installed and activated with a valid Xamarin license.\n* Your personal trial license key from \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/developer/licenses\" target=\"_top\"\u003eLicense Page\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n### Setup and Configuration\n\nThe setup chapter includes several guides to setup the Wikitude SDK (through the Wikitude SDK Component). If you want to create an empty app including the component or add it to an existing continue reading. Alternatively you can read about the packaged Sample App and how to use the Wikitude Component.\n\n- [Setup Component for app](#XamarinApp)\n- [Using the Wikitude Component](#UsingTheWikitudeComponent)\n\n\u003ca id=\"XamarinApp\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n#### Creating an empty new app \n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tip\"\u003e \n**Note** The guide is based on Xamarin Studio version 5.9.4\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n1. Open Xamarin Studio and open your existing solution or create a new one.\n\n    \n\n2. Download the Component from the Component Store by right click on `Components`\n3. Click `Get More Components`\n\n    \n\n4. In the Xamarin Component Store search for `Wikitude` and click `Add to App`\n\n    \n\n    \n\n5. The Component is now added to your application\n\n5. Add a `using Wikitude.Architect;` in all files where you need to work with the Wikitude Component (e.g. in your iOS view controller or Android activity).\n\n6. Start using the Wikitude Architect View as you would use any other native view in a iOS or Android project. Please refer to our Xamarin example application for a working demo of the Wikitude Component.\n\n7. Add a Architect World to your application resources. Please refer to our [examples](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/samples.html#examples) on how to write Architect Worlds.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tip\"\u003e\n**Note** Please make sure that your Architect World is correctly added to the final application bundle. Xamarin Studio treats folders outside of the Resources folder a bit odd and you would need to add each file itself to the bundle.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ca id=\"UsingTheWikitudeComponent\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n### Using the Wikitude Component\n\nThe Wikitude Component includes an example which demonstrates how to setup the ARchitect View and load an AR experience. To get started creating your own AR experience read through the chapters in the [Example section](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/samples.html#examples).\n\n##### Loading your augmented reality experience\n\nTo load an Architect World simply use the `LoadArchitectWorldFromUrl` method provided by the Wikitude SDK / Xamarin Component. It accepts either an URL pointing to the application bundle or on a remote server and a StartupConfiguration object with which you are able to set certain default values e.g. for the device camera.\n\nOn iOS, also the `Start` and `Stop` methods need to be called either when the presented view controller is about to be replaced by another one or the application moves into the background/foreground. Please refer to the example application on how to use both methods and when.\n\n##### Adding communication between Xamarin and ARchitect\n\nIn order to communicate with the augmented reality experience from within the Xamarin application the Wikitude SDK offers the `CallJavaScript(string javaScript)` method. The JavaScript will be evaluated in the context of the augmented reality experience. If the augmented reality experience is not fully loaded at the time this function is called, it will be evaluated as soon at the experience is loaded. \n\nThe Wikitude SDK defines a custom URL protocol which can be used to communicate from the ARchitect World to the Xamarin application. You can set a C# method that is called each time a `document.location = architectsdk://` load request is done. Please refer to the iOS/Android documentation or API reference for more information about the platform specific implementation details. \n\nThe Wikitude Component offers more functionality like to inject a custom location or to capture the screen and generate an image that can be shared on Twitter or Facebook. Please also refer to the [platform API documentation and reference](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/referencexamarin.html) for more information about the available APIs.\n\n##### Trial and commercial license\n\nBy default the Wikitude SDK comes with no valid license key. Read this chapter on how to [obtain a free trial key](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/triallicense.html).\n\nThen pass your license key into the SDK using the platform specific API.    \n\n### Further developer resources\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/developer/documentation/xamarin\" target=\"_top\"\u003eFull documentation and additional tutorials\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/developer/developer-forum\" target=\"_top\"\u003eDeveloper Forum\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/download\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude SDK Download\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/103004921345651739447/posts\" target=\"_top\"\u003eGoogle+ Page for News\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/newsletter\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude Newsletter\u003c/a\u003e\n","Hash":"fa3917a6c299edd6395c591fb3c92436","TargetPlatforms":["ios","ios-unified","android"],"TrialHash":null}
